```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
## Initialize everything

###  load any needed libraries

```{r loadlib, include=FALSE}
library(readr)
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(GGally)
library(caTools)
```
### Open Data Files


```{r loaddata}
eligible = readRDS("eligible.rds")
```
##  Add any needed columns to the table

The column *inducted* either has the value "Y" or "N".  To process the regression we need to create another column that has the value 1 if *inducted* is "Y" or 0 if it is "N".

```{r}
eligible$Indicator <- ifelse(eligible$inducted == "Y", 1, 0)
```

##  Make the trial and test sets of data

```{r}
set.seed(21)
theSplit = sample.split(eligible$Indicator, SplitRatio = 0.7)
TrainSet = subset(eligible, theSplit == TRUE)
TestSet = subset(eligible, theSplit == FALSE)
```
