## Applying Machine Learning to Project
How well can all-star appearances and other baseball player statistics predict the induction into the hall of fame for a player?

This is a supervised problem because we are attempting to predict a specific dependent variable using a model based on a set of independent variables.

This is a classification problem.

Based on some model testing, the independent variables I will use are as follows:

* All Star Game Appearances
* Non Pitcher Statistics
    + Career Hits
    + Career Home Runs
    + Career Batting Average
    + Career Runs Batted In
    + Career Runs Scored
* Pitcher Statistics
    + Career Wins
    + Career Strike Outs Thrown
    + Career Games Pitched

Because the independent variables are a mix of discrete/categorical variables and continuous variables, the Classification and Regression Trees (CART), specifically Random Forests, type model is a good choice.

I will be testing the random forest model both using a train/test split in the original data, and also using a new test data set.
